# New-York-Taxi-Analysis

This analysis seeks to explore the city's habits through the lens of publicly available taxi and Uber data. Over 133 million records were analysed which provided an insight on how the pandemic affected the taxi business. It also explores rush hour traffic, when do New Yorkers like going out, which neighbourhoods have an active nightlife and many more. 

Used **vaex** to work with this dataset. Vaex is a high performance Python library used to explore big tabular datasets.   
“Vaex uses memory mapping, a zero memory copy policy, and lazy computations for best performance (no memory wasted).”   

Using vaex allowed me to process the datasets and visualize them faster and saved up a lot of time.
